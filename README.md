Hearthstone Card Bot

This is an IRC bot which analyzes card data (extracted using Unity3D Pro from the carddata client file), parses it, and allows users to query this data from IRC.

To use, simply download the bin\Release files and edit config.xml. Then run hsbot.exe

Once online, you can say things like
"!card Arcane Intel"

or

"OMG he killed me with a [Pyroblast]!"
